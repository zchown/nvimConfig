This is my neovim configuration.

The goal of this configuration is to remain relatively minimal and out of the way. I try to keep things similar enough to a normal vim experience that using another machine with a default vim configuration won't feel unusable even if it does feel different.

Most of the additional functionality of this configuration comes from the use of plugins with the exception of a pretty extensive list of remaps. As well as a few custom functions.
